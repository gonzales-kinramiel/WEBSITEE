            <blockqoute>
              <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, let me introduce myself.<sup>1</sup> I'm Kin Ramiel M. Gonzales, i'm 20
                years old and i was born in Mamburao, province of Occidental Mindoro.<sup>2</sup> My birthdate is September 30,2004, and i
                am the childest on our family.<sup>3</sup> I wanna share to you my childhood story, teenage years, and college experience.<sup>4</sup>
                When i was a child, i used to play a lot of toys.<sup>5</sup> One thing that i remembered is when i'm 5 years old, i bring
                my gameboy to our school because i wanna brag it to my classmates and i wanna let them play it because i want
                them to experience how fun to have a gameboy.<sup>6</sup> But here's the funny part, i trade my gameboy to my classmate
                for a 5 piece of rubber band.<sup>7</sup> I dont' know what i was thinking because i'm only 5, so i trade it to him
                because i'm much happier on that rubber band.<sup>8</sup> Then my parents asked me "asan yung gameboy mo?" then i answered
                "pinagpalit ko na sa goma, mama e", then she scold me and i was crying a lot, but when i was crying, she said
                that "bukas pag hindi mo binalik gameboy mo, palo ka ulit sakin", then i realized that i can buy a rubber band
                because that was only 1 peso at that time.<sup>9</sup> So the day after that, i bring the rubber band that i trade to my
                classmate and i asked if i can trade it again to my gameboy, and my classmate didn't want to.<sup>10</sup> So i told my
                parents that "Mama, Papa. ayaw nya na ibalik yung gameboy", then my mom said "sige punta ako bukas sa school
                mo".<sup>11</sup> Then the day after that, she go to my school, she saw the gameboy and asked my classmate calmly "pwede ba
                makipag palit ulit sayo si Kin nung gameboy, nag iiyak kasi si Kin tungkol dyan e. bibilhan nalang kita ng
                lima pang lastiko", then my classmate gave it to my mom and i gave him the rubber band that he gave to me.<sup>12</sup> And
                i'm telling you, at this day we still laugh about it because i trade that to my classmate. but at that day, i
                learned my lesson, because my mom told me that "Okay lang naman magpahiram pero kung ipapalit mo yan sa
                lastiko, palo ka ulit sakin".<sup>13</sup> And that scared me because i dont wanna be scold.<sup>14</sup> I also remembered when i was
                12 years old, where are at a tutor on saturday morning, and i was with my bestfriends because we are running
                for honors.<sup>15</sup> When we have a tutor, we always bring Tennis racket because there's a tennis court near our tutor,
                and we always play when we are done.<sup>16</sup> We have a tricycle service at that time, so we're done playing and we're
                going back to our houses because it was lunch time.<sup>17</sup> Then, Alex (my friend) got too excited on our way home,
                like he's so hyper at that time.<sup>18</sup> So at that time, we pass a car, a Montero and he said "Boi, pag ako tinamaan
                tatamaan tong sasakyan na madadaanan namin", so we said "wag, Montero yan", then we passed it and he
                accidentally hit the Montero.<sup>19</sup> I'm telling you our face is so shocked, and the worst part here is the owner is
                on the car, and we didn't even stopped because we're to shocked and scared, maybe for like 5 mins we didn't
                spoke to each other.<sup>20</sup> Then Alex said "wala yan di naman tayo kilala non, di ko naman sinasadya din".<sup>21</sup> Then, when
                i arrived at my grandparents home, my mom picked me up there, and we're on a tricycle too.<sup>22</sup> I have a feeling
                that someone's following us on our way home, then when my mom stopped because she was going to buy pastillas,
                the owner of the car recognized me and said "sino yung humampas ng sasakyan ko?", and me who is still shocked
                said "kami po yun pero di namin sinasadya", then the owner said "bakit nyo hinampas, di manlang kayo tumigil
                para mag sorry", then that time i said sorry to them and the owner go without saying anything.<sup>23</sup> So the days
                comes by, then when we are at the Flag Ceremony, one of our teachers called us out on stage because he said he
                want to talk to us.<sup>24</sup> Then my teacher show some text, and it was the owner of the Montero, the text said
                "pupunta kami sa school para ipa guidance sila", then my heart stopped for a minute because we didn't do
                anything and we didn't do it on purpose.<sup>25</sup> Then the flag ceremony finished then we go to our classrooms, then
                our teacher is mad on us because we did something wrong, and that happened after tutor.<sup>26</sup> So out teacher is
                making us admit what actually happened, then Alex said that "si Kin po kasi ang kulit sa loob ng tricycle,
                kaya ko po nahampas", and i'm telling you i snitched on alex because he said that, i said "oy ako pa dinamay
                mo e sinabi mo na samin na pag dumaan tayo hahampasin mo", then we argued so much because Alex is saying that
                we are the reason why he hit it.v I can't share the things happened at the Guidance because it is a bit
                confidential but after the guidance, we all cried and our parents is there, who is mad on us too.<sup>27</sup> So we can't
                do anything on that scenario but we learned our lesson to not be too happy when we have a tennis racket.<sup>28</sup> But
                to this day, we also laugh about it on how stupid we are back in the day.<sup>29</sup> </blockqoute>

          <h2>
            <blockqoute> <b> Teenage Years </b></blockqoute>
          </h2>
          <div align="justify">
            <p>
              <blockqoute>
                <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that Teenage years is the best years of our life
                  because it's fun and we enjoy and we all have a core memories about this years.<sup>1</sup> So i took advantge and make
                  the most of it, like always saying to myself that "You Only Live Once" or YOLO.<sup>2</sup> I always go with the flow on
                  whats happening on my life back in the days.<sup>3</sup> But, that's the days that i chose to be close with God, because
                  i join Youth for Christ.<sup>4</sup> It's a community of youth's for God, and it was a best choice that i done.<sup>5</sup> On first
                  sight, i don't wanna join because i'm an introvert back then, but my siblings forced me to join because it
                  is fun and full with love and acceptance.<sup>6</sup> So i joined YFC and at first, it was hard for me because i don't
                  have confidence to talk with others.<sup>7</sup> But i just go with the flow and make friends on each and every people
                  who's there in Camp.<sup>8</sup> And i'm gonna tell you that it change my life, because at this day, i still have that
                  confidence to talk to others even though i'm not close to them, i'm a bit introvert now but it changes
                  everyday because of my confidence.<sup>9</sup> It was the best choice that i did because it helped me physically and
                  mentally, because of God, i can do things and God will always at my back to help me and guide me.<sup>10</sup> I also
                  have a friends who is still my friends because of YFC, one of them also helped me on my depression when i
                  was a teenager, and i'm so thankful for him, i'm not gonna say his name but i think when he read this, he's
                  gonna know that i'm mentioning him.<sup>11</sup> So back on the days when i'm teenager, i remember when i was grade 9.<sup>12</sup> I
                  have a friend who is mocking my classmates, he was mocking him at his back so he can't see it, so i told my
                  classmate that "Oy tignan mo oh, niloloko ka nito ng nakatalikod ka" but i said that like it's a joke.<sup>13</sup> And i
                  will tell you that my classmate ain't joking, he punch my friend at the chest, and my friend who took it
                  offensive, punched him back at the side of the face, and that began them fighting for their life, like they
                  are saying that "aabangan kita sa labas suntukan tayo dun!", and there was me, just laughing in the side.<sup>14</sup> So
                  my teacher found out that they are fighting, so she called guidance and they always talking to each other
                  that "ikaw ang nagpanguna e" and "hindi naman ako nagsimula!", then i admit to them that it's my fault, but
                  i didn't get guidance because i'm not the one who fight them both.<sup>15</sup> But they threatened me saying that "dapat
                  hindi mo ginawa yun, ikaw suntukin namin e", but their mood changed when i said "oh diba ako nag cause ng
                  away nyo pero ako din ang dahilan kung bat kayo magbabati", and we laugh about on the day after they got
                  guidance.<sup>16</sup> That was one of the most funniest things that i encountered.<sup>17</sup> One of the most achievements that i
                  got when i was in my teenage years was being 1st place on battle of the bands.<sup>18</sup> Region 4-B always have an
                  event every two years, and it's called "Regional Yourh Conference", and they always have an competetive
                  event like battle of the bands, sports, spoken poetry, etc..<sup>19</sup> So me and my bandmates who is also a YFC,
                  joined the battle of the band, and we are the youngest who joined there.<sup>20</sup> Kuya RR ( our kuya who taught us
                  some basics in our instruments) told us that before we even practice, so we have a pressure because we only
                  practice for about 4 momths and our competitors are always joining battle of the band.<sup>21</sup> But we didn't let
                  pressure beat us, we always practice like everyday for 4 months, it was hard and challenging but we get out
                  of our comfort zone and make the most of it.<sup>22</sup> On the day that we will perform na, our seniors and chapter
                  head told us that win or lose, they are proud of us, we also didn't expect that we will win because our
                  competitors has been bandmates for 4-5 years.<sup>23</sup> And when we are going up to the stage, i told them that "Okay
                  lang yung maging kabado, okay lang ma pressure. pero tandaan nyo, proud ako sainyo kung ano kakalabasan
                  natin. Gawin nyo lang yung na practice natin at i enjoy natin tong araw na to", and that gave them a
                  breather and confidence, so we perform and it came out pretty well.<sup>24</sup> On the day that will announce who wins,
                  we didn't care because we only did that for fun, but when the Occidental Mindoro was mentioned, we felt that
                  we are the champion.<sup>25</sup> Our smiles and happiness burst on that scene, even the other chapters are happy for us
                  and they didn't expect that we will win, our seniors and chapter head cries and burst with happiness too.<sup>26</sup> We
                  proved them that even though we're the youngest, we have an tough heart and mind, we bring home a silver and
                  that's like a gold to us.<sup>27</sup> </blockqoute>

                <blockqoute>
                  <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When i was going to college, i'm a bit pressured at the same time,
                    i'm a bit too shy because i'm having a hard time while going to college.<sup>1</sup> On the first day of college, i
                    didnt spoke to others because i'm shy.<sup>2</sup> But thankfully, John Mathew Sandalo and John Michael Caraig
                    approached me and said that if we can be friends.<sup>3</sup> so i said yes because i wanna explore on college and
                    make friends to others who is not in my province.<sup>4</sup> But they said that they made a bet on who's gonna
                    approach me and it was hilarious.<sup>5</sup> We always helped each other on certain things, like asking how to do the
                    code, asking activities and making activities, and having fun while doing things like reviewing and
                    groupings.<sup>6</sup> One of the most things that happened to me was we are at 1st year second sem, UE coach gave ma
                    an opportunity to play basketball on UE, and it was the best feeling i've ever gotten because that's my
                    dream and i'm having a step to achieve that dream.<sup>7</sup> So i worked hard everyday to pursue my dreams and to
                    have a free tuition.<sup>8</sup> So i started my training on February 20, 2024. but, certain things happened, i got
                    injured on April 15, 2024, and it was the worse day of my life.<sup>9</sup> April 22, 2024, we have a league called
                    PinoyLiga, it was a pre season of every schools and a fresh start to start the UAAP, but i got injured so
                    i didnt play.<sup>10</sup> I have a jersey on UE and it was all settled, i got to the roster and make the team.<sup>11</sup> The
                    doctors said that i can't play or even walk for about 4-6 weeks, when the doctors said that, my life and
                    dreams broke, i even insist my doctors that "Doc, pwede kaya ipa therapy ko nalang to" but the doctors
                    said no because i have a minor fracture on my right ankle.<sup>12</sup> That day, my hopes and dreams shattered and i
                    didn't reach my expectations.<sup>13</sup> i was depressed on that day and i have no hopes to play again.<sup>14</sup> But i didn't
                    let that slide, because when the day that i recovered from my injury, i go straight to my coach and said
                    that i wanna be back and i wanna be better and stronger.<sup>15</sup> So June 4 2024, the doctors removed my air cast
                    and able to play again after 2 months.<sup>16</sup> I got back to UE training on July 1, 2024, and they welcome me with
                    gratitude, they said that "gaw tagal mo nawala ah", and "welcome back pare!", that day my "gigil" got back
                    to play again.<sup>17</sup> But when UAAP season is coming, i didn't get my roster back, so i realized that i'm not
                    compatible at UE Men's basketball team, so right now i'm focus on studying and having a knowledge in IT
                    industry.<sup>18</sup> But, on 1st year 2nd sem, i got a failed in one subject, but i got it back because professors
                    did a remedial test.<sup>19</sup>Our professor have one condition to pass the test, to achieve the score that the
                    professor will say.<sup>20</sup> My score to pass is 78, out of 120, then the test ended and when i pressed the submit
                    button, my score is 79.<sup>21</sup> That day, i was so happy and so relief because i scored and i achieve the score
                    that my professor said.<sup>22</sup> And that's why i take my getbacks too serious and made 2nd year 1st sem seriously.
                    I don't know how 2nd year 2nd sem will take me, but i will let it go with the flow and will lift it to God
                    on what's happening and what will happen.<sup>23</sup> That's all for my sharing, i can't share anything that happened
                    to me because others a bit too conflict and too confidential, Thank you !<sup>24</sup></blockqoute>
